Client libraries no longer treat redirects as errors.  The methods that return redirects are those which involve fetching artifacts, and typically these have required generating signed URLs.  With this change, these methods can be called directly and will return a JSON payload containing a `url` property from which the artifact can be downloaded.  The fetch API does not support reading bodies from redirects, so this functionality is not available in `taskcluster-client-web`, which treats redirects as errors.
