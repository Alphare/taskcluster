Addresses #4942. Add `get_worker_pool_with_capacity_and_counts_by_state`, `get_worker_pools_with_capacity_and_counts_by_state`, and `update_worker_pool_with_capacity_and_counts_by_state` functions to get worker counts and capacity by state for worker pools.

Deprecates `get_worker_pool_with_capacity`, `get_worker_pools_with_capacity`, and `update_worker_pool_with_capacity`.
