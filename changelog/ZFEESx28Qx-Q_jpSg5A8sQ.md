The tutorial in the documentation has been updated and modified to offer better guidance for different deployments of Taskcluster.  The `ui.site_specific` configuration has a new, optional `tutorial_worker_pool_id` property (documented [here](http://docs.taskcluster.net/docs/manual/deploying/ui)) defining a worker pool for use by readers of the tutorial.
