This patch makes it so a user cannot click the `Terminate Worker` button on a Static or Standalone worker. This patch also moves the `Terminate Worker` button on the view individual worker page to the speed dial menu alongside the `Quarantine` button. These issues were first brought up in v44.15.0.
