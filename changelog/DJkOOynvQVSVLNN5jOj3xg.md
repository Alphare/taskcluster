Don't allow additional properties in `worker-response.yml` schema. Updated descriptions in `worker-response.yml` and `list-workers-response.yml` schemas to explain some default values that may occur in the case where the queue knows about the worker, but worker manager does not. Also, updated the GraphQL queries to extract additional needed data.
