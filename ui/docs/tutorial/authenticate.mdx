# Authenticating to Taskcluster

Taskcluster uses its own kind of "credentials" to [authenticate API
requests](/docs/manual/design/apis). These credentials can come from a variety of
sources, but in this section we will create a client manually, using the Tools
site.

If you haven't already, try the "[Hello World](hello-world)" tutorial to make
sure that you can sign in to the Taskcluster UI.

Once that's complete, you'll want to get some credentials.  See the advice in [Calling Taskcluster APIs](/docs/manual/using/api), which describes an easy way to do this with `taskcluster signin`.
In the end, you should have the following three environment variables set:

```bash
export TASKCLUSTER_ROOT_URL=..
export TASKCLUSTER_CLIENT_ID=..
export TASKCLUSTER_ACCESS_TOKEN=..
```

You can test the results with the `taskcluster` tool, too:

```bash
$ ./taskcluster api auth currentScopes
{
    "scopes": [
        "queue:create-task:proj-getting-started/tutorial"
    ]
}
```
