# Taskcluster-Github Checks

Taskcluster-Github supports [Github's Checks API](https://developer.github.com/v3/checks/).
At the moment, the feature is in beta. If you would like to try it out:
* Make sure you use `.taskcluster.yml` v1
* Add `reporting: checks-v1` line at the root level of your `.taskcluster.yml`
* You will need `queue:route:checks` scope for your `repo:github.com/org/repo:<action>` role.
* If you are using a decision task, make sure you add `route.checks` to the `routes` of your tasks
* If you have a locked-down deployment without allowing public artifacts fetching in your `anonymous` role, you must add
  `queue:get-artifact:public/github/customCheckRunText.md` and `queue:get-artifact:public/github/customCheckRunAnnotations.json`
  to the scopes of your task (`task.scopes`) to avoid an error comment being added to your
  commits. Note that this will change if you choose a custom artifact name (see below)

## Custom Text Output in Checks

When a task completes, the Taskcluster-GitHub service can optionally include task-specific information in the check run
displayed in the GitHub checks tab.  To do so, it looks for an artifact on the task named
`public/github/customCheckRunText.md` and uses the artifact content as the check run text.
The artifact name can be customized by setting `task.extra.github.customCheckRun.textArtifactName` in the task definition.
Whichever name you choose must be included in the `task.scopes` (`queue:get-artifact:<textArtifactName>`) as mentioned above if
it is not included in the `anonymous` role.

For example:
```
payload:
  ...
  artifacts:
    public/github/customCheckRunText.md:
      type: file
      path: checkrun.md
```
or, if for example all build results are in `public/results`:
```
payload:
  ...
  artifacts:
    public/results:
      type: directory
      path: results
task:
  extra:
    github:
      customCheckRun:
        textArtifactName: public/results/checkrun.md
```

## Custom Annotation Output in Checks

When a task completes, the Taskcluster-GitHub service can optionally include task-specific [annotations](https://developer.github.com/v3/checks/runs/#annotations-object)
in the check run. To do so, it looks for an artifact on the task named `public/github/customCheckRunAnnotations.json` and uses the artifact content as the check run annotation.
The artifact name can be customized by setting `task.extra.github.customCheckRun.annotationsArtifactName` in the task definition.
Whichever name you choose must be included in `task.scopes` (`queue:get-artifact:<annotationsArtifactName>`) as mentioned above if
it is not included in the `anonymous` role.
The json in that file will be passed along unchanged to Github and should be in their annotation format defined in the link above.

For example:

```
payload:
  ...
  artifacts:
    public/github/customCheckRunAnnotations.json:
      type: file
      path: checkrun.json
```

or, if for example all build results are in `public/results`:

```
payload:
  ...
  artifacts:
    public/results:
      type: directory
      path: results
task:
  extra:
    github:
      customCheckRun:
        annotationsArtifactName: public/results/checkrun.json
```

### Debugging Errors in Custom Output

* If you see a `Cannot GET blahblah (403)` kind of error, it's likely that your artifact is private. Make sure you use
  a public artifact (see note on the naming convention above).
* If there is no error at all and you don't see your custom text in the checkrun, it means there was a
  404 kind of error. It can mean the artifact wasn't created successfully or there is a typo in the name of your
  artifact or in your `extra.github.customCheckRun` section if you use one.
  Make sure the artifact exists and is named or referenced correctly.
