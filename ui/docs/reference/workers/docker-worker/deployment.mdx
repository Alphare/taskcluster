# Deployment

Docker Worker used to be released as part of the full Taskcluster release cycle.
[PR #6921](https://github.com/taskcluster/taskcluster/pull/6921) removed the Docker Worker build from the Taskcluster release cycle.
The final release of Docker Worker can be found [here](https://github.com/taskcluster/taskcluster/releases/download/v62.0.0/docker-worker-x64.tgz) from v62.0.0.
The release takes the form of a tarball, `docker-worker-x64.tgz`, attached to the Taskcluster release on the GitHub repository (v62.0.0 and earlier).
This tarball is specific to the Linux x64 architecture.

## Release Format

The release tarball contains the docker-worker source and its dependencies as well as a copy of the correct Node version.
It has a top-level directory named `docker-worker` and the entry point to run the worker is `docker-worker/bin/docker-worker`.

The tarball can be extracted anywhere on the filesystem that is convenient.
For example:

```shell
tar -C /usr/local -zxf docker-worker-x64.tgz
```

The corresponding [worker-runner config](/docs/reference/workers/worker-runner/runner-configuration) would contain

```yaml
worker:
    implementation: docker-worker
    path: /usr/local/docker-worker
```

You can check the version of a docker-worker tarball by running `docker-worker/bin/docker-worker --version`.
