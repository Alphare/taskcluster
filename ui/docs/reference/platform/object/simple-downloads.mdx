# Simple Downloads

In many cases, it's useful to be able to share a URL for an object such that a simple HTTP GET will result in that object's data.
For example, a link to a logfile for viewing in a browser, or an executable that can be downloaded in a shell script with `curl`.

That's what the `object.download` endpoint is for.
Its response body is not a JSON object like other API methods; instead, it returns a redirect to a location that serves the data dirctly.

Note that when the object service is used by the queue to store artifacts, the queue's `getArtifact` method provides similar behvaior to the `object.download` method.

This page describes the behavior and limitations of this simple download process.

## URL Format

The URL for a simple download is the URL of the `object.download` API method.
Given a root URL for the Taskcluster deployment, that looks like `<rootUrl>/api/object/v1/download/<name>`.
The `<name>` is urlencoded but can contain un-encoded `/` characters.

This request requires the Taskcluster scope `object:download:<name>`.
If that scope is public, then the simple form of the URL will be sufficient.
However, if that scope requires credentials, then the URL will need to be [signed with a bewit](/docs/manual/design/apis/hawk/signed-urls).

## Client Requirements

The client used to download the object must meet the following requirements:

* Able to follow HTTP redirects
* Signals an error on 4xx and 5xx HTTP responses

Unfortunately, `curl`'s default configuration does not meet these requirements.
We recommand the following invocation:

```
$ curl -sSL --fail $url
```
