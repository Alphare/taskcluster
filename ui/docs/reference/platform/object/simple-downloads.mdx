# Simple Downloads

In many cases, it's useful to be able to share a URL for an object such that a simple HTTP GET will result in that object's data.
For example, a link to a logfile for viewing in a browser, or an executable that can be downloaded in a shell script with `curl`.

That's what the `object.download` endpoint is for.
Its response body is not a JSON object like other API methods; instead, it returns a redirect to a location that serves the data dirctly.

Note that when the object service is used by the queue to store artifacts, the queue's `getArtifact` method provides similar behvaior to the `object.download` method.

This page describes the behavior and limitations of this simple download process.

## URL Format

The URL for a simple download is the URL of the `object.download` API method.
Given a root URL for the Taskcluster deployment, that looks like `<rootUrl>/api/object/v1/download/<name>`.
The `<name>` is urlencoded but can contain un-encoded `/` characters.

This request requires the Taskcluster scope `object:download:<name>`.
If that scope is public, then the simple form of the URL will be sufficient.
However, if that scope requires credentials, then the URL will need to be [signed with a bewit](/docs/manual/design/apis/hawk/signed-urls).

## Client Requirements

The client used to download the object must meet the following requirements:

* Able to follow HTTP redirects
* Signals an error on 4xx and 5xx HTTP responses

Unfortunately, `curl`'s default configuration does not meet these requirements.
We recommand the following invocation:

```
$ curl -sSL --fail $url
```

## Security Considerations

When loading an object using a simple download, a browser will follow the redirect and, if it renders the object in-window, will display the target URL in the address bar.
If that URL contains authentication information, such as for a private artifact, then it is vulnerable to disclosure via the `Referer` header or by a user copy/pasting it.

The [origin](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6454#section-7) of such a resource will, depending on the backend, be shared with many other objects.
For example, all objects in a single S3 bucket share the same origin.
This makes it particularly dangerous to serve HTML content directly to browsers from objects.

To avoid this, where supported by the backend, HTML content will be rendered with `Content-Disposition: attachment`.
This will cause browsers to download the content, rather than rendering it inline.
