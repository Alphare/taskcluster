# Download Methods

## Introduction

The Object Service does not directly handle object data.  Instead, it
coordinates data storage on other providers such as public clouds. That makes
downloads a little more complicated than they might otherwise be.

There are two ways to download an object from the service: the "full" process
and the "simple" process.  The "full" process is particular to the object
service, while the "simple" process is "plain HTTP" and works with any HTTP
client.

See ["Simple Downloads"](/simple-downloads) for details of the simple process.

## Full Downloads

The full download process involves making a request to the object service, via the `object.downloadObject` endpoint.
The response to this request contains the information required to download the object data.

Taskcluster will provide libraries to support this interaction.

## Download Methods

The full download process supports negotiation of a "method" by which the download will take place.
This negotiation accomplishes two things:
 * decouples download clients from the object service, allowing new, more advanced methods to be defined while maintaining support for older methods; and
 * allows the use of "unusual" technology when all parties support it -- for example, AWS supports Bittorrent downloads.

The `downloadObject` request contains a list of methods that the caller supports.
The object service determines the methods that it can support for the requested object and which are also supported by the client, then chooses the "best" of the matching methods.
The service then calculates a response for that method and returns it to the caller.

The `downloadObject` request can contain additional parameters, specific to the chosen method, but those are not considered in the negotiation.
The `acceptDownloadMethods` property in the `downloadObject` request contains all supported methods as properties, with their parameters as values.
Methods that do not need parameters simply use `true`.
For example, a request that can use either the `simple` or `superFancy` methods might look like:

```javascript
{
  acceptDownloadMethods: {
    simple: true,
    superFancy: {
      superParam1: 13,
      superParam2: 42,
    },
  }
}
```

The known methods are defined below.

### `simple` Download Method

The `simple` method implements [simple downloads](/simple-downloads).
The response contains a URL against which a `GET` request can be made to retrieve the object's data.

To use the simple method with `downloadObject`, pass the following payload:

```javascript
acceptDownloadMethods: {
  simple: true
}
```

### `HTTP:GET` Download Method

This is an example method that is not well-defined.
