# Transport Protocols

## Uploading and Downloading Objects

The Object Service does not directly upload and download objects, but acts as
an intermediary on behalf of other data storage service providers. To upload an
object, clients must make a request to the Object Service describing the object
to upload (`object.uploadObject`), and the Object Service responds with details
for the client to perform the upload directly.

Similarly, to download an object (`object.downloadObject`), a request must be
made to the Object Service describing the object, and the Object Server
responds with information for the client to download the object directly
(typically a URL).

## Protocols

Currently the Object Service supports the single protocol `HTTP:GET`. In order
to support additional protocols in future, upload and download requests from
clients should include an ordered list of preferred protocols to use, in the
`acceptProtocols` property of the upload/download request body. When additional
protocols are available, the Object Service will select a preferred protocol
from the union of its supported protocols and the `acceptProtocols` of the
client request.
