# AWS Backend Type (for AWS _and_ Google Cloud!)

The AWS backend type supports storing objects in the AWS S3 service, _and_ Google Cloud Storage service.

Google cloud support is possible thanks to the [interoperability API](https://cloud.google.com/storage/docs/interoperability).

The backend type stores object data in a single S3 bucket.
The S3 Key name is identical to the object name.
It can be configured to support buckets that allow public read access, or buckets that prohibit such access.
For private buckets, the backend generates signed URls to allow access to the data.
