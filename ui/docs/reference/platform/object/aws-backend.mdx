# AWS Backend Type (for AWS _and_ Google Cloud!)

The AWS backend type supports storing objects in the AWS S3 service, _and_ Google Cloud Storage service.

Google cloud support is possible thanks to the [interoperability API](https://cloud.google.com/storage/docs/interoperability).

The backend type stores object data in a single S3 bucket.
The S3 Key name is identical to the object name.
It can be configured to support buckets that allow public read access, or buckets that prohibit such access.
For private buckets, the backend generates signed URls to allow access to the data.

In cases where the data is public anyway, these URL signatures can cause unnecessary friction.
Setting `signGetUrls` to false in this case causes the backend to generate un-signed URLs, which are short and easy for users to pass around.

## Deployment Configuration

Configuration of AWS backends in the `object.backends` looks like this:

```yaml
backends:
  publicStuff:
    backendType: "aws"
    accessKeyId: "<aws access key ID>"
    secretAccessKey: "<aws secret access key>"
    bucket: "<bucket name>"
    signGetUrls: false # or true
    endpoint: "https://storage.googleapis.com" # for Google, or do not specify for AWS
```

The provided AWS credentials should have the following policy (with `<BUCKET_NAME>` replaced by the bucket name):

```JSON
{
    "Version": "2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Sid": "Stmt1462988481000",
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Action": [
                "s3:GetBucketCORS",
                "s3:PutBucketCORS",
                "s3:DeleteObject",
                "s3:GetObject",
                "s3:PutObject",
                "s3:PutObjectAcl",
                "s3:ListBucket",
                "s3:GetBucketLocation",
                "s3:GetObjectTagging",
                "s3:ListMultipartUploadParts",
                "s3:AbortMultipartUpload",
                "s3:PutObjectTagging",
                "s3:PutLifecycleConfiguration"
            ],
            "Resource": [
                "arn:aws:s3:::<BUCKET_NAME>",
                "arn:aws:s3:::<BUCKET_NAME>/*"
            ]
        }
    ]
}
```

For Google Cloud, the provided credentials should have "Storage Legacy Bucket Owner" and "Storage Legacy Object Owner".

The use of `signGetUrls` is described above.
If this configuration value is `false`, then the bucket should be configured to allow public read access.
AWS has many layers of "yes, I'm really quite sure" that must be clicked through to accomplish this.
