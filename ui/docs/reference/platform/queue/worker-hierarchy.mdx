# Worker Hierarchy

The queue defines a hierarchy of resources that consume tasks from queues:

## Worker Pools and Task Queues

A task queue contains tasks that expect to be executed in a specific environment, where "environment" means worker implementation, base operating system, host configuration, and so on.
A worker pool contains workers that all provide the same evironment.

Task queues are identified by `taskQueueId`, while worker pools are identified by `workerPoolId`.
These are two sides of the same coin: tasks in a task queue are executed by workers in a worker pool of the same name.

## Workers

[Workers](/docs/manual/task-execution/workers) are the entities that actually
perform work, and are identified by `workerGroup/workerId`. A worker claims and
performs work from a single worker type.

Workers can be declared, and metadata associated with them, via the
[declareWorker](/docs/reference/platform/queue/api#declareWorker)
API method.
