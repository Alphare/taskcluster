# Artifacts

## Artifact Storage Types

Each artifact has a storageType, defining how it is stored and how it behaves.
See the [Queue API documentation](./api) for details.

## Getting Artifacts

The queue service has a plethora of methods for accessing artifacts.
They are grouped in pairs, with a version taking a `runId` and a version that uses the latest run.

To get metadata about all of a task's artifacts, use `listArtifacts`/`listLatestArtifacts`.
For a single artifact, use `getArtifactInfo`/`getLatestArtifactInfo`.
None of these methods follow `link` artifacts.

To get artifact content, use `artifact`/`latestArtfact`.
These methods return a structure specific to the storage type.
For storage types that contain data, this structure will include enough information to access that data (such as a URL).

The alternative methods to get artifact content are `getArtifact`/`getLatestArtifact`.
These methods are similar to the "simple" download method supported by the object service.
They redirect to the backend data for artifacts containing data, or return an HTTP 424 error for `error` artifacts.
Typically, these methods are used with utilities like `curl` or `requests`, which handle bulk data transfer directly.
