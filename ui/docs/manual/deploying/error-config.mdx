# Error Configuration

Taskcluster can optionally report exceptions in the sevices to a central service for analysis.
This currently only supports Sentry, but other options may be added without much difficulty.

To set up Sentry, given a Sentry DSN, set the following Helm configuration:

```
errorConfig:
  reporter: SentryReporter
  dsn: ...
```
