# Cloud Networking

If you are using kubernetes deployment you would likely to use external Load Balancer
and Ingress Controller to expose your services to the internet.

You could also use autoscaling to create and remove pods based on the load.

## Keep-Alive Timeouts

It is important to set up keep-alive timeouts for your load balancer and ingress controller properly.

Usually cloud's load balancer has fixed timeout for keep-alive connections.
In case of [GCP](https://cloud.google.com/load-balancing/docs/https#timeout-keepalive-backends) it is 600 seconds.

Ingress controller should have keep-alive timeout that's larger than load balancer's timeout.
For example, 650 seconds.

Ingress, in turn, opens connections to the pods-services, which should have keep-alive timeout larger than that.
This can be set per-service using `KEEP_ALIVE_TIMEOUT_SECONDS` environment variable.

## Graceful Shutdown

When you are using autoscaling, pods can be removed at any time.
To make sure that existing connections are not dropped, you should use graceful shutdown.

Services and pods listen to `SIGTERM` signal and stop accepting new connections, while letting existing to finish.
Kubernetes deployments also have `terminationGracePeriodSeconds` option, which is set to 120 seconds by default.

If you are using different configuration make sure to handle termination gracefuly.
