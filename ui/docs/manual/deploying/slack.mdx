# Slack Integration

Taskcluster requires a Slack App in order to be able to post messages to Slack.

## Creating the Slack App

0. Nagivate to the [Slack App registry](https://api.slack.com/apps) and create a new app.
0. On the new App, navigate to App Home and follow the wizard until you have a Bot token.
    - You can add extra permissions here which allows the Slack bot to post in
      channels it is not added to: `chat:write.public`.
    - The Slack app must be added to all private channels manually.
0. On the OAuth & Permissions page, press Install App to generate the bot token.in
0. Copy the bot token down.

## Taskcluster Configuration

In the Helm templates, you'll need to set

```yaml
# The Slack API URL, optional, if you want to target a test server or similar.
notify.slack_api_url: https://slack.com/api/
# The Slack bot token used to post messages.
notify.slack_access_token: xoxb-SomeRandomLettersHere
```
