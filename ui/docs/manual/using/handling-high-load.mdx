# Handling High Load

When worker capacity is constrained, such as in a fixed pool of hardware, the
demand for work can outstrip available capacity.  When this occurs, Taskcluster
provides a few tools that can help.

## Priorities

Task [priorities](/docs/manual/tasks/priority) are useful to ensure that the most
important tasks are executed first.  When the capacity issues are transient,
this can be helpful.  However, it can cause starvation of lower-priority tasks
if higher-priority tasks consume all of the limited resources.

## Deadlines

Sometimes tasks are not useful after a given time has passed. For example, the
results of a test run are probably not useful more than 12 hours after the
push.  Setting appropriate task [deadlines](/docs/manual/tasks/times) can help to
remove such useless tasks from the backlog if they are not executed earlier.
