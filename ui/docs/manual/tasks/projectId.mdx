title: The projectId property
order: 46
---

Each task has a `projectId`.
The intent of this identifier is to associate the task with a particular usage of the deployment.
For example, in an organization building and testing several apps, the `projectId` might correspond to the app name.
The `projectId` can be a `/`-separated, scoped identifier, for example `<department>/<app>`.

Permissions to [manipulate](manipulating) a task are controlled by `projectId`.
In a simple case, this means that developers of an app can be given scopes containing that app's `projectId`, allowing them to manipulate their own tasks but not those of other teams.

Project IDs can also be used to track resource usage.
Tasks using the object service for artifact storage require that the `projectId` of the artifact objects match that of the parent task.
