# Manipulating Tasks

For the most part, once a task is created it is left to run to its final
resolution. However, there are a few API methods available to modify its
behavior after creation.

Permission for these methods is based on the task's `projectId`.
There are also legacy scopes relating to the `schedulerId`, but experience has shown that these scopes are not a practical way to control access.

## Rerunning

"Rerunning" a task is possible when the task is completed, but not yet past its deadline.
A rerun entails adding a new run to the task.
This is most often used for tasks that failed due to some intermittent issue, as the result of the last run is reflected in the result of the task.

However, note that task dependencies operate on the first resolution of a task.
That is, when a task fails, any tasks depending on it are executed (or not) accordingly.
Subsequent reruns do not affect those dependent tasks.

## Force Scheduling

A task which has unfinished dependencies is considered "unscheduled", and not yet
"pending". A scheduled task that depends on itself will remain in that state
until its deadline, unless it is *force-scheduled* with the Queue service's
`scheduleTask` method.  This moves the task into the "pending" state, allowing
workers to claim it.

This method can also be used on tasks which depend on other tasks that are
failed or unfinished.

## Cancelling

A task that is not yet complete can be cancelled. This is generally a
best-effort operation, useful for saving resources. Task execution may continue
for some time after an active task is cancelled, until the worker performing
the task attempts to reclaim it.
