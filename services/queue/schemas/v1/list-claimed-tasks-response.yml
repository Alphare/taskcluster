    description: |
      List of tasks that are currently claimed by workers and are not yet resolved.
      Results might not represent the actual state of the tasks,
      as they might be currently resolved by a worker or claim-resolver.

      Tasks are returned by claimed time, with the oldest claimed tasks first.

    title: "Continuation Token"
    description: |
      Opaque `continuationToken` to be given as query-string option to get the
      next set of dependent tasks.
      This property is only present if another request is necessary to fetch all
      results. In practice the next request with a `continuationToken` may not
      return additional results, but it can. Thus, you can only be sure to have
      all the results if you've called `listClaimedTasks` with
      `continuationToken` until you get a result without a `continuationToken`.
