    description: |
      Request the queue to link this artifact to the named artifact on the same
      task.  When a client fetches this artifact, the request will be treated as
      if the client fetched the linked artifact (including corresponding scope
      validation).  Note that the target artifact need not exist when this artifact
      is created.  It is allowed to create link cycles, but they will result in a
      400 response when fetched.
