    description: |
      List of tasks that are currently waiting for workers to be claimed.
      Results may not represent the actual state of the tasks,
      as they might be actively claimed by a worker.

      Tasks are returned in inserted order.

  continuationToken:
    type: string
    title: "Continuation Token"
    description: |
      Opaque `continuationToken` to be given as query-string option to get the
      next set of dependent tasks.
      This property is only present if another request is necessary to fetch all
      results. In practice the next request with a `continuationToken` may not
      return additional results, but it can. Thus, you can only be sure to have
      all the results if you've called `listPendingTasks` with
      `continuationToken` until you get a result without a `continuationToken`.
