# Object Service

The object service provides storage for large blobs of data.

## Development

No special configuration is required for development.

Run `yarn workspace taskcluster-object test` to run the tess.
Some of the tests will be skipped without additional credentials, but it is fine to make a pull request as long as no tests fail.
