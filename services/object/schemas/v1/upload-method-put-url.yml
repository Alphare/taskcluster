        type: string
        description: Content-type of the data to be uploaded.

  response:
    title: "`putUrl` upload response"
    description: |-
      Response containing a URL to which to PUT the data.
    type: object
    properties:
      url:
        type: string
        formt: uri
        description: URL to which a PUT request should be made.
      expires:
        type: string
        format: date-time
        description: |-
          Expiration time for the URL.  After this time, the client must
          call `createUpload` again to get a fresh URL.
      headers:
        type: object
        description: |-
          Headers which must be included with the PUT request.  In many
          cases, these are included in a signature embedded in the URL,
          and must be provided verbatim.

          The `Content-Length` header may be included here.  Many HTTP client
          libraries will also set this directly when the length is known.  In
          this case, the values should be identical, and the header should only
          be specified once.
